Welcome to our Moran process codebase. 
Please make sure you have all libraries installed before use. Check the requirements.txt before running the code.
To use the code, you have to run the main.py under the graphicTests folder. Once you have loaded the program you will see a lot of options, firstly, you have to choose the graph that you want to simulate. To do this you can choose the number related to the graph in the graph.py file under the classes folder. For example, if you wanted to simulate the cycle graph you would put 2 in the top left corner of the program. Next you can choose to add nodes or links to the graph you have loaded. If you don't want to then you can move onto the next step. In the bottom right you will have the option to choose the infected node and the number of them. Once you are happy you can press simulate. This will simulate the graph and show you the results. If you wish to watch how it got to the end you can use the rewind button in the bottom right, to go back and watch what nodes got infected and which ones didn't.
